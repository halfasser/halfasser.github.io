Marked by a minimal wardrobe and buzzing my head, the "monk phase" was a period where I responded to external/social pressures with detachment. 

My parents and grandparents wanted me to finish my degree, but doing so wouldn’t align with what I believed. The monk phase was an exercise in alignment, to prove to myself that I could follow my own path—without consequence and full of benefits. As individuals, it’s important to be aligned with one’s inner self in order to live in harmony.

If I feel forced to conform, I **will** grow resentful of my environment. 

That feeling is seldom based in reality, though. No one is forced to do anything—we just respond as if we are, unless we’re mindful about our decisions.
