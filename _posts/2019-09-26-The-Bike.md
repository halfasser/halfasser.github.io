Imagine someone giving you the nicest bicycle money can buy.

Surely, you're going to try the bike out and ride it pretty much everywhere for at least a week, because who wouldn't? It was free, you've got to use it!

After a while, you realize that walking suits you better. You enjoy the slower pace, since it allows you to think while you get to your destination, instead of worrying about people texting and driving and all the other dangers of biking. Everywhere you need to go is within walking distance, anyway.

So you put the bike away and start walking again.

The person who got you the bike hears about this. They don't like that you've decided to walk instead of using that perfect bike they gave you. Why would you walk, when the bike would get you there so much faster, more efficient, and in a more stylish manner?

*Why would you insult them by not using the gift they got you? That gift was perfect! You've been walking all over the place, aren't you tired of it? What's wrong with you?*

There's no amount of explaining or gratitude that would make them come to terms with your decision, because your denial of their perfect gift reflects negatively on them. Their ego is hurt by your decision. To them, you're obviously the problem here.

You'll probably spend some time thinking about the decision and hop back on the bike every once in a while out of guilt, but you still prefer walking.

So you keep walking.
