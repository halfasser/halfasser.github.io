## An Immediate Detour

We've now turned off of the Jekyll route onto the Gatsby road...an interesting development. 

This is what happens when you have no idea what you're doing and you blindly follow the crumbs of info you pick up along the way.

This whole project has been like finding my way through a maze, when I could probably just find a map of the whole thing on the internet somewhere.

**No. Too easy.**

## Back to Square One

So for the past couple of hours I've been following[ this Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) which also kind of functions as a crash course in React. It's nice, since I've been wanting to learn JS for a while but never had a concrete application for it until now with the React framework.

I can't wait to become even **more** of a fucking stereotypical generalist designer that only knows surface-level knowledge about 239472920 things.

*anyway...*

Gatsby seems cool and useful for what I want to do. It's going to take longer than I would *like* but what's new. I'm being patient. This shit's complicated and I'm trying to learn 5 things at once here. I can give myself a break...or a pep talk.

## Pep Talk/Review

We're usin' **the terminal**.

We got **Gatsby** installed.

We're followin' **the tutorial.**

We're makin' **Git repositories**.

We're linkin' our repository to **Netlify.**

We're deployin' on **Netlify.**

We said **"Hello World!"**

**We're gettin' there.**
