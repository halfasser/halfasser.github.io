*I decided I would make today a "zero consumption" day.*

*Some might call it a fast, but I like to do things my own way.*

# Why?

*Before you do anything, it's best to know why you're doing it.*

First of all, **it's good to challenge yourself**. I feel like I haven't had a good physical challenge in a while since I stopped going to the gym, even though I've started to bike to work recently.

Secondly, I feel like I've strayed from the line that I like to stay on. I've been eating more fast food, watching more YouTube than I'd like, and just spending time in ways that I don't really want to. **I've gotten away from my self and it's true desires.**

Thirdly, this challenge is a radical act of mindfulness—a solid whack in the head to make me aware of where I am and assess my situation so I can sort myself out. If I can discipline myself to make it through this one day of "hell" (to my current self), then surely I can make it a habit to wean myself off of whatever bad habits I have picked up.

# Rules

1. No food or drink, except water.
2. No social media.
3. No consumption of media, except books.
4. No group chats.
5. Try not to sleep the day away.
6. Track your time.

# Principles

Over the past week, I've been getting back into meditation and working on making it a habit. So far, so good, and I'm feeling better already. Most of that good feeling is probably from the novelty of picking up a "new" thing to do, so it'll most likely fade within a few days. By fasting, I plan to myself aware and accustomed to the eventual boredom that will set in once that novelty wears off.

**This whole thing is about the habitualization of the alignment process:**

1. Thought
2. Mindfulness
3. Consideration
   1. Resistance
   2. Visualization
4. Action
5. Appreciation

Mindfulness set this thing in motion when I "caught" the thought of fasting when it came to mind while I was trying to fall asleep last night. I began to consider it, thinking about what it might look like and how I would feel while doing it, and how satisfied I would be after completing the fast. I thought it would give me a deep sense of satisfaction, like after doing a good deed for someone. **This time, the deed is for myself.** There's not enough of that in my life, so I made the decision to go for it.

The most interesting part of the process is when the resistance kicks in. You'll find any way possible to rationalize how something's a bad idea or bargain with yourself to put it off or make things "easier" because *you just have it so hard right now, do you really need another thing to worry about?* In these cases, the sooner you act, the better. If you wait, the spiral of resistance only goes deeper. 

At the top of the spiral, you'll be greeted by your good friend Self Doubt. On the way down, you'll pass through the Tunnel of Shame, cross the Bridge of Regret, and swim in the Pools of Escapism. It's such a fun time—after all, you're not working! **Nothing's better than that!**

# Journal

#### 10:04 AM

Two hours into work, and the novelty is beginning to wear off. The feeling of hunger has been steady since I woke up, and I'm starting to notice the lack of coffee in my system. I think the lack of caffeine might be the worst part of this so far. 

*Disclaimer: I drank the tiny bit of coffee that was left in my carafe from yesterday, but that's nothing compared to my usual coffee intake.*

It'd be nice to go outside and get some sunshine and get my blood flowing, but I'm the only one manning the desk right now, and no one is scheduled to show up until I leave. Hm.

There's definitely some discomfort from a lack of stimulation. I'm really craving a hit of dopamine right now. I think I'm going to step outside.

...

I'm back. Do I feel better? Yeah, a little. Still hungry, though. I usually skip breakfast, so this isn't anything out of the ordinary. I'm just trying to *feel* how I feel.

*Another disclaimer: I've allowed myself to hit my JUUL during my breaks. I'm rationalizing it by using it as a pick-me-up, but let's not fool anyone—I'm just addicted to nicotine.*

I'm looking at my to-do list, and I'm feeling some resistance. It feels like I would rather do nothing than what's on that damn list. Writing isn't on the list, so it "feels better" to do this instead. Of course it does.

#### 11:15 AM

I'm thinking about allowing myself to eat, as long as I prepare the food myself. Thinking about going all day without eating is really fucking me up right now. Maybe I'm just *so bored* that eating would be a nice little shot of dopamine for me right now. I don't know, I'm still on the fence about it.

#### 4:01 PM

So I got off work at 1 PM, put a load of laundry in the washing machine, and laid down to rest my tired eyes. Three hours later, here we are. The laundry is in the dryer, and another load has been...*loaded?*

I'm strongly considering eating when I go out to pint night with friends tonight. A low priced, delicious burger would be the perfect way to end today's fast.

Only a few hours left if I decide to indulge tonight.

#### 5:50 PM

I caved and got on Twitter. So I guess this is it huh?

Was it worth it? Eh, not really. I didn't miss out on anything.

# Lessons

Making tasks into a game/challenge for myself to take part of is an interesting strategy. It flips the dynamic of the "oppressive to-do list" on its head and helps keep my purpose at a conscious level. Staying mindful of why I've set certain goals for myself is one of the best ways for me to get anything done, since impulsivity takes over if not.
