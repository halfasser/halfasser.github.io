It's about time that I write about Halfasser in a normal tone. There's been so many times that people have asked about it, and I just ended up rambling.

In the original writings, I described Halfasser as "my shadow" but in conversations I've had, I've said it was something like an acceptance of everyone's opinion of me. I don't know.

Going by the name Halfasser is obviously a self-deprecating act on the surface. It stems from the self-hatred spirals that take place when I fail to meet expectations â€” my own, or others.

**This "chronic letdown syndrome" is cured by the dissolution of expectations. I've always enjoyed breaking expectations, shock, surprise, etc.**

When you decide to act according to your own principles, strengths, and personality, there's going to be some friction.

Not only is there friction between you and those you interact with (especially close loved ones), but there's the friction between the many sides of "you". I think this is really where **alignment** comes into play. It takes some reflection, some meditation, or whatever you gotta do to reduce that friction, but in the end it's what you need to do to gain some sort of focus or clarity.

Without deep inner clarity, you'll be beholden to external influences that are hiding in the recesses of your mind.

*Clarity comes and goes, of course. We're human.*
