## *in media res*...

**Here's the deal:**

I've been trying to get a portfolio site up and running for a while now. There's loads of solutions to this simple problem, but being a hardheaded and cheap person narrows down my options.

In the past, my portfolio site was hosted on [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com/), which syncs projects from [my Behance profile](https://behance.net/KeganCochran) and builds the site according to whatever template I chose. It was easy, functional, and great.

*but...*

I've never been a template guy. If I use a template, I want to dissect it in order to make it mine. Even then, it's like templates **always** have some weird quirk built into it that pisses me off every time I see my website.

*so...*

## Plan A*

**Actually, it's more like Plan C or D, but we're starting fresh, baby.*

My current plan is to figure out how to build a simple portfolio site using a CMS to...manage the content on my site, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which would be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). That way, I'll have full control over my website, I'll own the code, and it's open source. Beautiful.

[We're gonna start with this tutorial, and see where we go from there.](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/)
