## My Favorite Place

I've been following along to [this Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial) and things have been going well.

"Going well" in this case means that I have been reassured that I am capable of following written instructions. **That's all, really.** I've completed the Gatsby Fundamentals chapter of the tutorial, so I've gotten familiar with the process of creating a Gatsby site, adding content, and styling it all.

*but...*

I'm just familiar with the **process**, and I don't *really* understand what's going on under the hood.

I don't necessarily expect myself to know what every line of code does, but as I carried on with the tutorial it became abundantly clear that I ought to study the code I've been copy-pasting this whole time.

**The false sense of gratification has worn off...we've entered Tutorial Hell.**

I've completed enough of the Gatsby tutorial to "make my own site," but now it's just a matter of really **understanding** what's going on. That means a whole lot of tinkering (breaking) in order to learn how this beautiful bundle of code makes websites so I can finally make my own and justify all the (arguably unnecessary) work I've put into this endeavor.

It'll all be worth it.
